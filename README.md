- 👋 Hi, I’m @scrooges-ghost. I've been in crypto since 2015 and published my first smart contract to the Ethereum main net in 2016. I'm here to show our current economic system (aka MR. EBENEZER SCROOGE) the ways it is living wrong in hopes to change its trajectory.
- 👀 I’m interested in Ethereum / web3 development. This noted, the code that I publish on Ethereum (or any other chain for that matter) is simply me expressing my right to free speech in the form of written code. If my code ever becomes more than code to others, whatever it may become is the responsiblity of those using it, not me the author.  
- 🌱 I’m currently learning how flawed our existing systems are and how Ethereum can fix that. 
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on anything related to Ethereum, web3, or other blockchain related projects. 
- 📫 How to reach me ... for now, scrooges_ghost@protonmail.com, perhaps elsewhere eventually.

## Budil on, frens :) ##
